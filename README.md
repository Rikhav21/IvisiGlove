# Invisoglove
So this is basically a glove with flex sensors, a gyroscope, and a accelerometer, so it can tell exactly what your hand's position is at all times. I think that this will allow for some pretty interesting use cases, like an invisible keyboard, a mouse, game conrol, ro pretty much just make it into any input devise for you laptop. This sort of reminds me of the nintendo controllers for we, except it has a lot more detail, and is fit to your hand.
To build this I am going to use:
A raspberry pi, gyroscope, lipo battry, a bluetooth module, and flex sensors. I know that some people were able to DIY flex sensors, when I tried to in the past they were useually unreliable, so this time I will stick to buying them. Most of the components are pretty flexible,and were mainly just what I had on hand.
