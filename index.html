    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      InvisiGlove is a wearable glove built using flex sensors, a gyroscope,
      and an accelerometer that can track the exact position and movement
      of your hand at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      This enables some pretty interesting use cases — an invisible keyboard,
      a mouse, game control, or essentially any custom input device you want
      for your laptop. Conceptually, it’s similar to the Nintendo Wii controllers,
      but with far more detail and designed to fit directly to your hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      To build this project, I used:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>Gyroscope</li>
      <li>Accelerometer</li>
      <li>Li-Po battery</li>
      <li>Bluetooth module</li>
      <li>Flex sensors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While some people have successfully DIYed flex sensors, my past attempts
      were usually unreliable. This time, I decided to use commercial flex sensors
      for consistency. Most of the components are fairly flexible and were chosen
      largely based on what I already had available.

    <h2>The Wiring</h2>
    <p>
      The wiring is fairly straightforward. The flex sensors are connected to
      GPIO pins 26, 27, and 28, each with a pull-up resistor to ground and powered
      from 3.3V.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gyroscope is connected using pins 0 and 1. This setup allows the system
      to read both finger bending and hand orientation simultaneously.

    <h2>The Setup</h2>
    <p>
      After wiring everything up, you can upload the <code>final.py</code> script
      to the Raspberry Pi. From there, the sensitivity of the flex sensors can be
      adjusted to reliably differentiate between bent and straight fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once calibrated, I pulled a glove over the electronics and fitted it to my hand.
      At that point, the glove becomes whatever you code it to be — the behavior is
      entirely software-defined.
